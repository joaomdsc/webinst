# webinst

`webinst` (as in "web application instance") is a script to instantiate a web
application skeleton. The skeleton follows Miguel Grinberg's Flask
mega-tutorial.

Running the `webinst` script creates a sub-directory for the application in the
current directory, and installs every dependency so that the application can be
immediately run.
